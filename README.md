## <a id="project_header"></a>Project Proposal

### Project Overview

The project focuses on cryptocurrencies and providing our users with a tool which allows them to observe insights into the "top ten**" cryptocurrencies. 
We would like our users to be able to use the visualisations presented to find out more about how these selected cryptocurrencies as well as their recorded past. 




### Data Sources

Our data will either be pulled from Binance or Coin Gecko's APIs.
We are going to explore the information obtainable from each to decide which is the most appropriate. 

[Binance API](https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/#general-info)


[CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api)




### Overview of Visualisations 

We hope to visualise the following three points: 

* Traded volume over time, where the data filter can be set by the user. 
* Value against either GPB or USD over time. 
We would like one of these two visualisations (maybe both) to use a [bar chart race](https://observablehq.com/@d3/bar-chart-race) plot.
* A third visualisation which allows the user to select a single cryptocurrency and displays the relationship between the traded volume and its value against USD or GBP over time.
